# Hospital Management System (HMS) - Sequence Diagrams

This folder contains comprehensive sequence diagrams for all major modules of the Hospital Management System, documenting the end-to-end flows and interactions between different system components.

## Overview

The sequence diagrams in this folder provide detailed visual representations of how different actors (users, systems, and external services) interact with the HMS modules to complete various business processes. Each diagram follows the Mermaid sequence diagram format and can be rendered in any Mermaid-compatible viewer.
